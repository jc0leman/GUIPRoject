This is the ReadMe manual for Jackson Colemans GUI Dice Game

use the terminal to navigate the game. your role is the input that you enter,
and in similar fashion to russian roulette, you can check to see if your di square is deadly.
However, sometimes JFRAME has issues with the DI, and if this is the case, oddly going into full screen
and then leaving it will solve your problem.
